# Golden Hearing Experimental Hearing Test
A mockup for a hearing test which tests the users temporal hearing loss. Created in collaboration with LUMC's Golden Hearing initiative. This test aims to research the value of everyday/musical sounds over 'laboratory-like' sounds as test sounds for hearing tests.
