## Golden Hearing Experimental Hearing Test

This project features a mockup for a hearing test specifically designed to assess users' temporal hearing loss. Developed in collaboration with LUMC's Golden Hearing initiative, the test explores the potential value of everyday and musical sounds compared to more traditional 'laboratory-like' sounds for hearing assessments.
